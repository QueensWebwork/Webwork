BEGIN_TEXT 

One mole of ammonia gas is contained in a vessel which is capable of
changing its volume (a compartment sealed by a piston, for
example). The total energy \(U\) (in joules) of the ammonia is a
function of the volume \(V\) (in liters) of the container, and the
temperature \(T\) (in deg. K) of the gas. A linear approximation of
\(\Delta U\) is given by

\[ \Delta U = $rV \Delta V + $rT \Delta T \]


$PAR
a)  At what rate does the energy change if the volume is held constant and the temperature is increased slightly?  Include units in your answer.

b)  At what rate does the energy change if the $BBOLD temperature $EBOLD is held constant and the $BBOLD volume $EBOLD is increased slightly?  Include units in your answer.

c) Find the approximate change in energy if the gas is $dvDirection by
$absdV m\(^3\) and its temperature is $dTDirection by $absdT degrees K.  Include units in your answer.  Recall that 1 \(m^3\) = 1000 L.
