Carly consumes a lot of coffee.  Sometimes she will drink so much
coffee that she can feel her heartbeat in her face. This has got Carly
concerned (althrough not enough to stop drinking coffee) and she has
started tracking her coffee intake.  
$PAR 
Over the past three days, Carly has plotted her coffee intake rate and has found it follows the function
\(c(t) = $rate_function\), where \(c\) is in cups per day, and
\(t\) is in days.

$PAR (a) $BBOLD On your solution sheet$EBOLD, sketch a graph of
Carly's consumption rate over the time interval \(t=0 \ldots
3\). Clearly show the scale on the vertical and horizontal axes.
$BR
(There is nothing to submit for this part in Webwork.)

$PAR 
(b) What is the total amount of coffee Carly consumed over the three day period 
\(t=0 \ldots 3\)?
$BR
Total coffee consumption: \{ $total_consumption->ans_rule(8) \} cup(s)

$PAR
(c)  Use the formula for the average value of a function to compute Carly's average
consumption rate over \(t=0 \ldots 3\). Show all your work on your worksheet.
$BR
Average consumption rate: \{ $average_rate->ans_rule(8) \} cups/day

(a) The graph is a shifted and scaled cosine graph.
$BCENTER
\{ image( insertGraph($gr), 
width=>200,height=>200,tex_size=>800 ) \}
$ECENTER
$BR
(Click on graph to enlarge)
$PAR
(b) The total consumption is the integral of the rate, so
$BR
\[\mbox{Total consumption } = \int_0^3 $rate_function ~dt \\
= \left($base t + \frac{$mult}{2 \pi} \sin(2 \pi t)\right) \Big|_0^3 \\
= $total_consumption  \mbox{ cups} \]
$PAR
(c) The average consumption is the total consumption over the whole time period ($total_consumption cups), 
divided by the total time (3 days), or 
$BR
Average consumption rate = $average_rate cup(s)/day.
