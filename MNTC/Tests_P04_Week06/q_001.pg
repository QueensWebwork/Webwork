$PAR
You want to build an open-ended cylindrical container (a tube, and one circular end piece) with a total surface area of \($area_const \pi ~\mbox{cm}^2\).  The radius of the cylinder will be \(r \) cm, and the height \( h \) cm.

$PAR
a) Write a function for the volume of the cylinder which only involve \(r \) (and $BBOLD not$EBOLD \(h\)).
$BR \(V(r) = \) \{ans_rule(30)\} 
$PAR
  b) Either by hand, or using "fminbnd" in MATLAB, find the dimensions of such a cylinder for which the $BBOLD volume is maximized $EBOLD.  (For this step, upload either your by-hand work or your MATLAB script when you are done.) 
$BR
\(r = \) \{ans_rule(15)\}  cm
$BR
\(h = \) \{ans_rule(15)\}  cm
$BR
			     Resulting volume = \{ans_rule(15)\} \(\mbox{cm}^3\)
$BR
Give all your answers to at least 4 digits of accuracy.
$PAR
c) Use MATLAB to plot the graph of volume \(V\) against radius \(r\).  On the graph, add a dot at the point representing the maximum volume.

You should upload your MATLAB .m script file when you upload your scanned hand-written work.
