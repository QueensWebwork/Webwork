
Isolate and modularize the eigenvector calculation in MATH337/Unit02 and Unit05.  Examples exist in 

Unit05MarkovDecisionProcesses/MachineMaintenanceIntro

Calculus/Unit01_Functions/q_001.pg is messed up, and testing it seems
to not work very well.  I don't know what to do with it, but I've
dropped it from the corresponding Self-test for now.

Check up on some of the MATH_121_Test files: those have been used for 4 years running now...
