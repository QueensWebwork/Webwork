BEGIN_TEXT
Consider the differential equation
\[\frac{dy}{dx} = (x-$aa)e^{-$bb y}\]
satisfying the initial condition \(y($aa)=\ln($aa)\).
$PAR
(a) Find the particular solution that satisfies the  differential equation.
$BR
\(y\)=  \{ ans_rule(45)\}
$PAR

(b) In your written answers, verify your answer is correct by showing
that your solution satisfies the original differential equation.
