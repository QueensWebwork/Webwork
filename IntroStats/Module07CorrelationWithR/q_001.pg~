$PAR
This data describes the responses to a survey of departments in a company about how the employees feel about aspects of the company's management.  Managers want to investigate the relationship between $BBOLD $variable$EBOLD and the $BBOLD OverallRating $EBOLD.

$PAR

$PAR 
(a) Plot a scatterplot with $variable on the x axis, and OverallRating on the y axis. Which of the following graphs most resembles your plot?  (Click to open a graph in a new window.)

(c) Using R, find the value of the \(t_{obs}\) for a correlation test of the $variable with OverallRating:  \{ans_rule(20) \}

(d) When comparing this \(t_{obs}\) to the null distribution, how many degrees of freedom
are there for the null hypothesis \(t\) disribution?
$BR degrees of freedom: \{ans_rule(20) \}

$PAR
(e) Critical \(t\) statistic with \(\alpha = 0.05\), \(t_{crit}\): \{ans_rule(20) \}  (Find this critical score for a 2-tailed test, and give the positive value.)
$PAR
(f) Sketch a normalized t distribution (see the Practice Problems for examples), and add \(t_{obs}\) and \(t_{crit}\) on the plot of the null \(t\)-distribution. Shade in the appropropriate region that represents the probability
  of a value as large or more extreme that \(t_{\mbox{obs}}\), in either direction.
