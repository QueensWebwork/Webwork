$PAR
This data describes the responses to a survey of departments in a company about how the employees feel about aspects of the company's management.  Managers want to investigate the relationship between $BBOLD $variable$EBOLD and the $BBOLD OverallRating $EBOLD.

$PAR

$PAR 
(a) Plot a scatterplot with $variable on the x axis, and OverallRating on the y axis. Which of the following graphs most resembles your plot?  (Click to open a graph in a new window.)

(b) From R, find the value of the \(t_{obs}\) for a correlation test of the $variable with OverallRating:  \{ans_rule(20) \}
