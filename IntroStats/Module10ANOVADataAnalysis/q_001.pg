BEGIN_TEXT
An experiment is conducted to determine whether there is a difference among the mean increases in
growth produced by four growth hormone treatments (A, B, C, and D) for plants.  The experimental
material consists of 16 cuttings of a shrub with four cuttings each randomly assigned
to each of the four different strains.  The increases in weight for each cutting 
are included in the Excel dataset.

Assume that this data satisfies the criteria for an ANOVA F-test.

Compute the following, including at least 3 non-zero digits in your answer: $BR
(b) F observed for the ANOVA: \{ans_rule(20)\} $BR
(c) p value for the ANOVA \{ans_rule(20)\} $BR
(d) Which of treatment pairs (if any) differ by a significant amount at \(\alpha = 0.05\), based on the Tukey HSD test?
