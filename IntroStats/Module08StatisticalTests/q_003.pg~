Researchers assigned 
During the study, the women were classified into two groups: a comparison group (healthy,
uneventful pregnancy) and a group with gestational diabetes (women who
developed diabetes during pregnancy).  All the women were between 25
and 40 years old.

Also measured for each woman was:
- Body Mass Index (BMI) pre-pregnancy (continuous numerical)
- Smoker (Yes/No: categorical)
- Baby's gestational age at birth in weeks (continuous numerical)
- Baby's birth weight in grams (continuous numerical)

(a) What kind of study design is this?

(b) If the researchers were trying to test for 
[$description_text], 
what statistical test would be appropriate?
