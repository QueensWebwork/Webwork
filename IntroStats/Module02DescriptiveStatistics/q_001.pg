$BR 
The dataset below contains information about \{ $description \}.
$BR
Find the following properties of this \{ htmlLink("${htmlURL}$excel_filename", "Excel dataset (.xlsx)")\}.

$PAR
a) What is the median of the variable labelled $BBOLD$variable$EBOLD? 
$BR(This variable represents $variable_descr)
$BR
\{ans_rule(10)\} is the median value.

$PAR
b) What is the lowest value of the variable labelled $variable? 
$BR
\{ans_rule(10)\} is the minimum value.

$PAR
d) What is the highest value of the variable labelled $variable? 
$BR
\{ans_rule(10)\} is the maximum value.

$PAR
d) Give the range in which the middle 50% of the measured values will lie (i.e. the IQR):
$BR
50% of the data lies between \{ans_rule(10)\}  and \{ans_rule(10)\}.
$PAR
Note: there are slight variations in how the IQR can be computed.  Use R to obtain the value for this question.

#ANSWERS
ANS($median->cmp() );
ANS($min->cmp() );
ANS($max->cmp() );
ANS($quart1->cmp() );
ANS($quart3->cmp() );

BEGIN_SOLUTION
$PAR 
All of this information can be seen using the "summary" command in R. E.g.
summary(MyData${DOLLAR}$variable)
$PAR
The range covering the middle 50% of the measured values is between the 1st quartile and the last quartile, 
or the IQR.
