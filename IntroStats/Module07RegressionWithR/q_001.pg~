$PAR
This data describes the numer of arrests (per 100,000 population) for various crimes in states in the USA.
Also included for each state is the variable UrbanPop, which is the percentage of the state population
living in urban centers (in the range 0%-100%).

$BR Researchers want to build a regression model from the percentage of urban population, $BBOLD UrbanPop$EBOLD, to the $BBOLD$variable$EBOLD arrest rate, and are specifically interested in whether the $BBOLD slope$EBOLD in the regression model differs significantly from 0 slope. 

$PAR
(a) Plot a scatterplot with UrbanPop on the \(x\) axis, and $variable
on the \(y\) axis. Which of the following graphs most resembles your
plot?  (Click to open a graph in a new window.)
$BR
 1. \{ image( "$shuffled_graph_filenames[0]", width,350 )  \} 2. \{ image( "$shuffled_graph_filenames[1]", width,350 ) \} 
$BR
 3. \{ image( "$shuffled_graph_filenames[2]", width,350 ) \} 
$BR
Graph: \{ $popup_graph->menu() \}

$PAR
(b) \{ $mc_H0 ->print_q() \} 
\{ $mc_H0 ->print_a() \}

$PAR
(c) Using R, find the value of the \(t_{obs}\) for a linear regression test of the $BBOLD slope$EBOLD relating UrbanPop and $variable :  \{ans_rule(20) \}

$PAR
(d) In the null hypothesis \(t\) distribution, what are the degrees of freedom are there?

$BR degrees of freedom: \{ans_rule(20) \}

$PAR
(e) Critical \(t\) statistic with \(\alpha = 0.05\), \(t_{crit}\): \{ans_rule(20) \}  (Find this critical score for a 2-tailed test, and give the positive value.)
$PAR
(f) Sketch a normalized t distribution (see the Practice Problems for examples), and add, for the slope of the regression, \(t_{obs}\) and \(t_{crit}\) on the plot of the null \(t\)-distribution. Shade in the appropropriate region that represents the probability
  of a value as large or more extreme that \(t_{\mbox{obs}}\), in either direction.
$BR
Which of the following graphs most resembles your sketch?  (Click to open a graph in a new window.)
$BR
 1. \{ image( "$shuffled_tdist_filenames[0]", width,350 ) \} 2. \{ image( "$shuffled_tdist_filenames[1]", width,350 ) \}
$BR
 3. \{ image( "$shuffled_tdist_filenames[2]", width,350 ) \} 4. \{ image( "$shuffled_tdist_filenames[3]", width,350 ) \} 
$BR
Graph: \{ $popup_tdist->menu() \} 
 

$PAR 
(g) 
\{ $mc ->print_q() \} $BR
\{ $mc ->print_a() \}

$PAR 
(h) 
\{ $mc_scientific_conclusion ->print_q() \} $BR
\{ $mc_scientific_conclusion->print_a() \}

$PAR 
(i) Interpretation: Pretending for a moment that the slope result was significant (even if it wasn't),
what is the formula for the regression line relating UrbanPop and the $variable arrest rate?
$BR
Murder Rate per 100,000 = \{ans_rule(10) \} + UrbanPop (%) \(\times\) \{ans_rule(10)\}
$BR
(Additionally, for practice, try using the "abline" command in R to add this regression line to your plot.)
