</p><ol>
<li><strong>Mathematical Symbols Available in WeBWorK</strong>
  <p>
  </p><ul>
    <li>+ &nbsp;Addition
    </li><li>- &nbsp;Subtraction
    </li><li>* &nbsp;Multiplication. Multiplication may also be indicated 
      by a space or juxtaposition, that 
      is, just writing symbols next to each other, e.g. 2x, 2 x or 2*x, also 
      2(3+4). You can use the latter form, without a space, only provided
      no misunderstanding is possible. For example,
      you wouldn't enter 34 for 3*4. To be on the safe side, you should always use * for
      multiplication.
    </li><li>/ &nbsp; Division
    </li><li>^ or ** &nbsp;Denotes powers. (2^3 and 2**3 are the same to WeBWorK)  
    But, you have to sometimes be careful with negative numbers with fractional exponents.
    For example, rather then enter (-2)^(1/3), it would be better to enter -(2^(1/3)).
    </li><li> All kinds of  brackets and paretheses: (...), [...], {...}
  </li></ul>

<p>
</p></li><li><strong>Syntax for entering expressions</strong>
<p>
</p><ul>
  <li>Be careful entering expressions just as you would be careful entering 
  expressions in a calculator. 
    <p>
  </p></li><li>Sometimes using the * symbol to indicate multiplication makes things 
  easier to read. For example (1+2)*(3+4) and (1+2)(3+4) are both valid. So are 
  3*4 and 3&nbsp;4 (3 space 4, not 34) but using a * makes things clearer. 
    <p>
  </p></li><li>Use ('s and )'s to make your meaning clear. You can also use ['s and ]'s 
  and {'s and }'s. 
    <p>
  </p></li><li>Don't enter 2/4+5 (which is 5.5) when you really want 2/(4+5) (which is 
  2/9). 
    <p>
  </p></li><li>Don't enter 2/3*4 (which is 8/3) when you really want 2/(3*4) (which is 
  2/12). 
    <p>
  </p></li><li>Entering big quotients with square brackets, e.g. [1+2+3+4]/[5+6+7+8], is 
  a good practice. 
    <p>
  </p></li><li>Be careful when entering functions. It's always good practice to use 
  parentheses when entering functions. Write sin(t) instead of sint or sin t. 
  But WeBWorK is smart enough to accept sin t or even sint. But sin 2t is really 
  sin(2)t, i.e. (sin(2))*t. Be careful. 
    <p>
  </p></li><li>Be careful entering powers of trigonometric, and other, functions. 
    You write (sin(t))^2
   for the square of sin(t), and <i>never</i> sin^2t. 
    <p>
  </p></li><li>For example, 2+3sin^2(4x) is wrong. You should enter:
   2+3*(sin(4*x))^2. Why does the last expression work? Because 
    things in parentheses are always done first [ i.e. (4*x), and then (sin(4*x))], 
    next all exponents 
    are taken, giving (sin(4*x))^2, next all multiplications and divisions are 
    performed, giving 3*(sin(4*x))^2. Finally, all additions and subtractions 
    are performed, giving 2+3*(sin(4*x))^2.
    <p>
    You could have entered 2+3sin(4x)^2. (Indeed, things in parentheses
    go first, giving (4x), next functions are evaluated, giving sin(4x), next
    all exponents are taken giving sin(4x)^2, next all multiplications and divisions
    are performed, giving 3sin(4x)^2. Finally, all additions and subtractions are
    done, leading to 2+3sin(4x)^2.) However, isn't 2+3*(sin(4*x))^2 much clearer than
    2+3sin(4x)^2? Why not be clear?
    </p><p>
   </p></li><li>Remember that multiplication and division have the same precedence
   and there are no universal rules as to which should be done first in the
   absence of paretheses. WeBWorK and many computers read things from left to
   right, so 2/3*4 means (2/3)*4=8/3. But some other computers will read
   2/3*4 as 2/(3*4)=1/6. The same lack of consistent rules concerns powers,
   expressions like 2^3^4.

  <font color="red"><b> The only way to make sure
   that you are entering what you want to enter is the use of
   parentheses!!!</b></font> 
    <p>
  </p></li><li>Use the "Preview Button" to see exactly how your entry looks. E.g. to tell 
  the difference between 1+2/3+4 and [1+2]/[3+4] click the "Preview Button".
    <p>
  </p></li><li>If a problem calls for a decimal answer, give at least <b>five significant
   digits</b>,
   or as many as the problem specifies.
   For example, write 2.3453 instead of 2.34.
  </li></ul>

</p></li><li><strong>Intervals in WeBWorK</strong>
<p>
  </p><ul>
  <li>What is the domain of f(x)=sqrt(x)?  On answer is x&gt;=0 (x is greater than or equal to 0).
      The way to enter this in WeBWorK is in interval notation: [0,infinity).
  </li><li>Other intervals:  
     <ul>
     <li>(2,3] is the set 2&lt;x&lt;=3.
     </li><li>(-infinity,5) is the set x&lt;5.
     </li><li>(-infinity, infinity) is the set of all real numbers.
     </li><li>(2,3]U[4,5) is the set 2&lt;x&lt;=3 or 4&lt;=x&lt;5.
         (This is a union of two intervals and can be very important.)
