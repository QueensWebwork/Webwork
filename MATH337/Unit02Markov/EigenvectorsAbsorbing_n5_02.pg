Consider the Markov chain implied by the one-step transition matrix P below.
$BR
\{mbox( '\(P = \)', display_matrix($P))  \}  
$BR
  Here are the some of the normalized real eigenvectors of \(P\), written as row vectors, and with their corresponding eigenvalues (\(\lambda\)):
  \{  mbox(  '\(\lambda = $e_1\)' , display_matrix($P_v1)) \}
  \{  mbox(  '\(\lambda = $e_2\)' , display_matrix($P_v2)) \}
  \{  mbox(  '\(\lambda = $e_3\)' , display_matrix($P_v3)) \}
  \{  mbox(  '\(\lambda = $e_4\)' , display_matrix($P_v4)) \}
$BR
  Similarly, here are some of the normalized real eigenvalues and corresponding vectors of \(P\) $BBOLD transpose$EBOLD. 

  \{  mbox(  '\(\lambda = $e_1\)' , display_matrix($Pt_v1)) \}
  \{  mbox(  '\(\lambda = $e_2\)' , display_matrix($Pt_v2)) \}
  \{  mbox(  '\(\lambda = $e_3\)' , display_matrix($Pt_v3)) \}
  \{  mbox(  '\(\lambda = $e_4\)' , display_matrix($Pt_v4)) \}

$PAR
A) Is this Markov chain $BBOLD irreducible $EBOLD (all states recurrent)? \{  $mc1->print_a() \}    
$PAR
B) If the states are numbered from 1 to \($N\), and you $BBOLD start in state \{$start_state\} $EBOLD, what is the probability in the long run that you will be in $BBOLD state \{$end_state\} $EBOLD? 
Give your answer rounded to 3 digits after the decimal.
$BR
Probability = \{ans_rule(15) \}
$BR
Note that this question is deliberately ambiguous; it describes either:
<ul>
<li>the probability of ending in an absorbing state if there is one, or 
<li>the long-term probability of being found in a recurrent state.  
</ul>Use whichever interpretation is appropriate given the model.

$PAR

 C) Consider the matrix defined by \( \lim_{n\to \infty} P^n\). Where
in this matrix would you $BBOLD also $EBOLD find the value you gave in part B)? 
Select the $BBOLD most general $EBOLD answer.
