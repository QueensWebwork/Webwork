
Lecture 1 - Markov chain intro
  - any definitions, examples of state sequences that would _not_ be Markov?
  - generation of a simple transition probability matrix
  
Simple example, turn into P matrix (RainModel_PMatrixAndSquare)

Sum of rows in P must be 1. (PMatrix_SumsInTransition.pg)
Truck Model - one-step probabilities (TruckModel_OneStepProbabilities.pg)

---------------

Lecture 2 - Markov chain powers
  - probability of multi-step transitions
  - probability in the long run, using high power approximation.
  
Interpretation of p^2_ij - PMatrix_TransitionInterpretation.pg

-------------
Lecture 3 - classes of states, classification of states 
Match the transition probability matrix to a diagram.
  - include self-loops/not include self-loops

Match a transition diagram to a transition probability matrix. 
  - include self-loops/not include self-loops

Identify classes - too easy, all of them understood that.

Identify transient states vs recurrent states 

Alternate statements/consequences of the definitions of transient and
recurrent states.
