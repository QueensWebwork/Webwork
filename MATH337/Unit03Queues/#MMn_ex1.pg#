BEGIN_TEXT

$PAR A small car repair shop, with one mechanic, is being modeled as
an M/M/1 queue.  

$PAR Cars are dropped off at the shop at a rate of $lam cars per day
(over an 8 hour open day), and it takes the mechanic on average
$service_time hours to service a car.  The mechanic also works 8 hours
per day.

$PAR A. Complete the following table of probabilities.  (Assume that
the shop is essentially in steady state, and that in principle the
queue would be allowed to be infinitely long.)

\{ begintable(2) \}
\{ row("Number of cars at the shop", "Probability") \}
\{ row("0", ans_rule(15) )\}
\{ row("1", ans_rule(15) )\}
\{ row("2", ans_rule(15) )\}
\{ endtable() \}

$PAR B.  The owner is considering advertising to increase his business
(i.e. promote more cars arriving at the shop for service). What is the
theoretical maximum average number of cars that his current mechanic
can support, without the queue going out to infinity?  $BR Round your
answer $BBOLD down $EBOLD to the nearest integer.

$BR Maximum avg arrival rate: \{ans_rule(5)\} cars per day.

$PAR C.  Assume the owner advertises, and increases the arrival rate
of customers to $lam2 cars per day.  The owner also opens a second
repair bay and hires a second mechanic, with the same service
abilities as the first (i.e both service a car in $service_time hours
on average). With this change, the shop could be considered an $BBOLD
M/M/2 $EBOLD queue.

$BR
Complete the following table, assuming that a second mechanic were hired. 
	 
$BR
$BBOLD Note:$EBOLD you will have to look up or derive the steady-state
distribution for an M/M/2 queue.

\{ begintable(2) \}
\{ row("Number of cars at the shop", "Probability") \}
\{ row("0", ans_rule(15) )\}
\{ row("1", ans_rule(15) )\}
\{ row("2", ans_rule(15) )\}
\{ endtable() \}

$PAR

D. Under the M/M/2 model, out of an 8 hour day, how long on average is
exactly one of the mechanics idle?  

$BR Hours exactly one mechanic is idle: \{ans_rule(10)\}.
